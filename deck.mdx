```notes
- suppose you have 3 files -- A, B, and C -- where B and C depend on A

- if A exposes mutable state, the dependencies go BOTH ways

- not only that..

- you might assume B and C are unrelated (they should be)

- they could live in completely different libraries and simply share a common dependency

- but if each mutates state in A, they now have direct (and time-sensitive) dependencies on each other

- this connection is implicit

  - the behavior and dependencies don't materialize until the code is running

  - i.e. they require _time_ to be moving to see and explain

  - or "running" in a developer's head

- worse case of "invisible code"

  - changing any of these files can break the others as well

- they share.. mutable state

```notes

- but we should separate these unrelated things to lessen the surface area for bugs

- here we split the dnd state from the rest of the FileUpload state

- render props are a great pattern for isolating state

```notes
- back in the FileUpload component, state is dedicated to this new logic

- we could use a render prop to separate it as well

- at first glance HoC are similar, but they blend props and logic back together again to create the end result

- render props also work very nicely with type systems, while HoC do not
```

<Problem>problem #5</Problem>

# complexity increases exponentially

```notes
- examples so far fairly small, condensed to one or two problems

- in real apps, unchecked mutability can quickly get out of hand

- consider the angular1 example earlier

  - building large multi-step forms

  - many controllers, many watchers, ownership unclear

  - terrifying to edit

  - I laid the seeds for this mess by leaning heavily on mutability while the form was still "simple"

  - 3 years later it was no longer maintainable

- consider modern frameworks

  - jQuery was _the_ tool for a long time

  - it's now become somewhat infamous for creating mountains of spaghetti code

  - not to say jQuery is at fault, it's really the DOM APIs

  - modern tools like React (and its spinoffs) or Elm present the DOM abstractly using mostly immutable data

# important points

- mutability makes dependencies more complicated
- mutability hides change
  - create new copies when updating
  - return updates, don't inject them
- mutability introduces time-dependent bugs
- mutating a value "claims ownership" of the value
  - multiple owners is bad
  - request changes instead (using immutable data, like actions/messages)
- many processes which seem to require mutability can be described with observables
  - rx autocomplete
- need mutability at some point.. describe changes desired (testing, ioc)
